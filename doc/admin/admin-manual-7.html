<P>This judging system was developed with security as one of the main
goals in mind. To implement this rigorously in various aspects
(restricting team access to others and the internet, restricting
access to the submitted programs on the domjudge systems, etc...)
requires root privileges to different parts of the whole contest
environment. Also, security measures might depend on the environment.
Therefore we have decided not to implement security measures which are
not directly related to the judging system itself. We do have some
suggestions on how you can setup external security.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc7.1">Considerations</A>
</H2>


<P>Security considerations for a programming contest are a bit different
from those in normal conditions: normally users only have to be
protected from deliberately harming each other. During a contest we
also have to restrict users from cooperatively communicating,
accessing restricted resources (like the internet) and restrict user
programs running on judgehosts.</P>
<P>We expect that chances are small that people are trying to cheat
during a programming contest: you have to hack the system and make use
of that within very limited time. And you have to not get caught and
disqualified afterwards. Therefore passive security measures of
warning people of the consequences and only check (or probe) things
might be enough.</P>
<P>However we wanted the system to be as secure as possible within
reason. Furthermore this software is open source, so users can try to
find weak spots before the contest.</P>

<H2><A NAME="security:internal"></A> <A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc7.2">Internal security </A>
</H2>


<P>Internal security of the system relies on users not being able to get
to any vital data (jury input/output and users' solutions). Data is
stored in two places: in files on the DOMjudge system account and in
the SQL database.</P>
<P>Files should be protected by restricting permission to the relevant
directories.</P>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> the database password is stored in
<CODE>etc/dbpasswords.secret</CODE>. This file has to be
non-readable to teams, but has to be readable to the web server to let
the jury web interface work. A solution is to make it readable to a
special group the web server runs as. This is done when using the
default configuration and installation method and when <CODE>make
install-{domserver,judgehost}</CODE> is run as root. The webserver group
can be set with <CODE>configure --with-webserver-group=GROUP</CODE>; by
default it is tried to be determined from groups available on the
system, e.g. <CODE>www-data</CODE> or <CODE>apache</CODE>.</P>
<P>Judgehosts and the domserver communicate with each other over HTTP.
Also all parties accessing the domserver web interface obviously use
this protocol. We advise to setup HTTPS so interactions between domserver,
judgehosts and teams are all protected. If you need to use a self-signed
certificate, you can consider to install it on the team workstations
beforehand to minimize hassle.</P>
<P>When using IP address authentication, one has to be careful that teams
are not able to spoof their IP (for which they normally need
root/administrator privileges), as they would then be able to view
other teams' submission info (not their code) and clarifications and
submit as that team.
<EM>Note:</EM> This means that care has to be taken e.g. that teams
cannot simply login onto one another's computer and spoof their identity.</P>
<P>Problem texts can be uploaded to DOMjudge. No filtering is performed
there, so make sure they are from trusted sources to, in the
case of HTML, prevent cross site scripting code to be injected.</P>

<H2><A NAME="security:rootprivs"></A> <A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc7.3">Root privileges </A>
</H2>


<P>A difficult issue is the securing of submitted programs run by the
jury. We do not have any control over these sources and do not want to
rely on checking them manually or filtering on things like system
calls (which can be obscured and are different per language).</P>
<P>Therefore we decided to tackle this issue by running these programs in
a environment as restrictive as possible. This is done by setting up a
minimal chroot environment. For this, root privileges on the judgehosts
and statically compiled programs are needed. By also
limiting all kinds of system resources (memory, processes, time,
unprivileged user) we protect the system from programs which try to
hack or could crash the system.  However, a chroot environment does
not restrict network access, so there lies a possible security risk
that has to be handled separately, see further below.</P>
<P>The optional (but strongly recommended) Linux cgroups system can be
enabled to block network access and provide a few other extra security
measures.</P>

<H2><A NAME="security:fileprivs"></A> <A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc7.4">File system privileges </A>
</H2>


<P>Of course you must make sure that the file system privileges are set
such that there's no unauthorised access to sensitive data, like
submitted solutions or passwords. This is quite system dependent. At
least <CODE>&lt;judgehost_judgedir&gt;</CODE> should not be readable by other users
than DOMjudge.</P>

<H3><A NAME="security:webprivs"></A> Permissions for the web server </H3>


<P>The default installation sets permissions correctly for the web
server user (commonly <CODE>www-data</CODE> or <CODE>apache</CODE>).
The following information is for those who want to verify the setup
or make modifications to the settings.</P>
<P>Care should be taken with the <CODE>etc</CODE> directory: the
<CODE>domserver-{config,static}.php</CODE>, <CODE>dbpasswords.secret</CODE>
and <CODE>restapi.secret</CODE> files should all be readable, but
<CODE>dbpasswords.secret</CODE> and <CODE>restapi.secret</CODE> should not be
readable by anyone else. This can be done for example by setting the
<CODE>etc</CODE> directory to owner:group &lt;DOMjudge
account&gt;:&lt;Web server group&gt; and permissions
<CODE>drwxr-x---</CODE>, denying users other than yourself and the
web server group access to the configuration and password files.</P>
<P>If you want the web server to also store incoming submission sources on
the file system (next to the database), then <CODE>&lt;domserver_submitdir&gt;</CODE> must be
writable for the web server, see also 
<A HREF="admin-manual-3.html#install_config:storage_submissions">storage of submissions</A>.</P>
<P>You should take care not to serve any files over the web that
are not under the DOMjudge 'www/' directory, because they might
contain sensitive data (e.g. those under <CODE>etc/</CODE>). DOMjudge
comes with <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files that try to prevent this, but
double-check that it's not accessible.</P>

<H2><A NAME="security:external"></A> <A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc7.5">External security </A>
</H2>


<P>The following security issues are <EM>not</EM> handled by DOMjudge,
but left to the administrator to set up.</P>
<P>Network traffic between team computers, domserver and the internet
should be limited to what is allowed. Possible ways of enforcing this
might be: monitor traffic, modify firewall rules on team computers or
(what we implemented with great satisfaction) put all team computers
behind a firewalling router.</P>
<P>Solutions are run within a restricted (chroot) environment on the
judgehosts. This however does not restrict network access, so a
team could try to send in a solution that tries to send input testdata
back to them, access the internet, etc... A solution to this problem
is to disallow all network traffic for the test user on the judgehosts.
On Linux, this can be accomplished by modifying the
iptables, adding a rule like:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
iptables -I OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner &lt;testuser_uid&gt; -j REJECT
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Note that when using cgroups, network access <EM>is</EM> restricted by
default and the above is not necessary.</P>
