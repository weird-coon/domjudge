<H2><A NAME="problems:chroot"></A> <A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.1">Setting up a pre-built chroot tree </A>
</H2>


<P>With the default configuration, submitted programs are run within a
minimal chroot environment. For this the programs have to be statically
linked, because they do not have access to shared libraries.</P>
<P>To be able to run submissions of languages that don't support statically
linked binaries (think interpreted languages and bytecode compiled
languages, amongst which Java and C#), one can build a bigger chroot
environment which contains all necessary ingredients to let the
submissions run. DOMjudge supports this with some manual setup.</P>
<P>First of all, a chroot tree with those interpreters or runtimes needs to
be created. The script <CODE>bin/dj_make_chroot</CODE> can create one from
Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux sources. Add the required packages for the needed
languages to the <CODE>INSTALLDEBS</CODE> variable in the script; run the
script without arguments for basic usage information.</P>
<P>This pre-built chroot tree is not directly used as chroot environment
for judgings. Instead, some subdirectories of this tree are
bind-mounted into a chroot tree that is specifically created for each
judging. The bind-mounting and a few other things are done by the
script <CODE>lib/judge/chroot-startstop.sh</CODE>, when the pre-built tree
is available.</P>
<P>Finally, if necessary edit the script <CODE>lib/judge/chroot-startstop.sh</CODE>
and adapt it to work with your local system. In case you changed the
default pre-built chroot directory, make sure to also update the sudo
rules and the <CODE>CHROOTORIGINAL</CODE> variable in <CODE>chroot-startstop.sh</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.2">Java compilers</A>
</H2>

<P>Java is difficult to deal with in an automatic way. It is probably
most preferable to use OpenJDK or Oracle Java, because that's the
version contestants will be used to. The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) is
easier to deal with but may lack some features.</P>
<P>The recommended way of using Java is by setting up the chroot as in the
previous section, but you can also choose one of the alternatives as
described below.</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> As an alternative the <CODE>gcj</CODE> compiler from GNU can be
used instead of Oracle's version. This one generates true machine
code and can link statically. However a few function calls
cannot be linked statically (see `GCJ compiler warnings' in
this FAQ). Secondly, the static library <CODE>libgcj.a</CODE>
doesn't seem to be included in all GNU/Linux distributions: at
least not in RedHat Enterprise Linux 4.</LI>
<LI> One can disable the chroot environment in
<CODE>etc/judgehost-config.php</CODE> by disabling <CODE>USE_CHROOT</CODE>.
Disabling the chroot environment removes this layer of
security against submissions that attempt to
cheat, but it is a simple solution to getting Java to work, for
demo or testing purposes. <B>Note</B>: no guarantees about system
security can be made when running a contest with chroot disabled!</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.3">The Java virtual machine (jvm) and memory limits</A>
</H2>


<P>DOMjudge imposes memory limits on submitted solutions. These limits
are imposed before the compiled submissions are started. On the other
hand, the Java virtual machine is started via a compile-time generated
script which is run as a wrapper around the program. This means that
the memory limits imposed by DOMjudge are for the jvm and the running
program within it. As the jvm uses approximately 300MB, this reduces
the limit by this significant amount. See the <CODE>java_javac</CODE> and
<CODE>java_javac_detect</CODE> compile executable scripts for the
implementation details.</P>
<P>If you see error messages of the form
<HR>
<PRE>
Error occurred during initialization of VM
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread
</PRE>
<HR>

or
<HR>
<PRE>
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not reserve enough space for object heap
</PRE>
<HR>

Then the problem is probably that the jvm needs more memory than what is
reserved by the Java compile script. You should try to increase the
<CODE>MEMRESERVED</CODE> variable in the java compile executable and check that
the configuration variable <CODE>memory limit</CODE> is set larger than
<CODE>MEMRESERVED</CODE>. If that does not help, you should try to increase the
configuration variable <CODE>process limit</CODE> (since the JVM uses a lot of
processes for garbage collection).</P>
<P>Note that (especially on x86_64 machines) the jvm seems to preallocate
huge amounts of memory, up to 2 GB! This is not actually all used, but
the memory restriction in DOMjudge will flag it as such, unless Linux
cgroups are enabled, then the actual memory used is measured. Thus, we
strongly recommend using Linux cgroups when using the Oracle jvm.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.4">Java class naming</A>
</H2>


<P>Java requires a specific naming of the main class. When declaring the
main class <CODE>public</CODE>, the filename must match the class name.
Therefore one should <EM>not</EM> declare the main class public; from
experience however, many teams do so. Secondly, the Java compiler
generates a bytecode file depending on the class name. There are two
ways to handle this.</P>
<P>The simplest Java compile script <CODE>java_javac</CODE>
requires the main class to be named <CODE>Main</CODE> with method
<HR>
<PRE>
public static void main(String args[])
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The alternative (and default) is to use the script
<CODE>java_javac_detect</CODE>, which automatically detects the
main class and even corrects the source filename when it is declared
public.</P>
<P>When using the GNU gcj compiler, the same holds for the
<CODE>java_gcj</CODE> script as for <CODE>java_javac</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.5">GCJ compiler warnings</A>
</H2>


<P>When using the GNU GCJ compiler script <CODE>java_gcj</CODE> for compiling
Java sources, it can give a whole lot of warning messages of the form
<PRE>
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/3.2.3/libgcj.a(gc_dlopen.o)(.text+0xbc):
In function `GC_dlopen': Using 'dlopen' in statically linked
applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc
version used for linking
</PRE>
</P>
<P>These are generated because you are trying to compile statically
linked sources, but some functions can not be static, e.g. the
`dlopen' function above. These are <EM>warnings</EM> and can be safely
ignored, because under normal programming contest conditions people
are not allowed to use these functions anyway (and they are not
accessible within the chroot-ed environment the program is run in).</P>

<H2><A NAME="problems:memory"></A> <A NAME="ss8.6">8.6</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.6">Memory limit errors in the web interface</A>
</H2>


<P>When uploading large testdata files, one can run into an error in
the jury web interface of the form:
<PRE>
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XX bytes exhausted (tried to
allocate YY bytes) in /home/domjudge/system/lib/lib.database.php
on line 154
</PRE>

This means that the PHP engine has run out of memory. The solution is
to raise the memory limits for PHP. This can be done by either editing
<CODE>etc/apache.conf</CODE> and raising the <CODE>memory_limit</CODE>,
<CODE>upload_max_filesize</CODE> and <CODE>post_max_size</CODE> values to well
above the size of your largest testcase. You can change these parameters
under the jury directory or by directly editing the global Apache or
<CODE>php.ini</CODE> configuration. Note also that <CODE>max_file_uploads</CODE>
must be larger than the maximum number of testcases per problem to be
able to upload and edit these in the web interface.</P>
<P>The optional PHP Suhosin module may also impose additional limits; check
your error logging to see if these are triggered. You may also need to
raise MySQL's <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> parameter in
<CODE>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</CODE> on both server and client.</P>

<H2><A NAME="runguard-rootprivs"></A> <A NAME="ss8.7">8.7</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.7">Compiler errors: `runguard: root privileges not dropped' </A>
</H2>


<P>
<PRE>
Compiling failed with exitcode 255, compiler output:
/home/domjudge/system/bin/runguard: root privileges not dropped
</PRE>

When the above error occurs on submitting any source, this indicates
that you are running the <CODE>judgedaemon</CODE> as root user. You should
not run any part of DOMjudge as root; the parts that require it will
gain root by themselves through sudo. Either run it as yourself or,
probably better, create dedicated a user <CODE>domjudge</CODE> under
which to install and run everything.</P>
<P>Also do not confuse this with the <CODE>domjudge-run</CODE> user:
this is a special user to run submissions as and should also not
be used to run normal DOMjudge processes; this user is only for
internal use.</P>

<H2><A NAME="problems:apport"></A> <A NAME="ss8.8">8.8</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.8">found processes still running ... apport</A>
</H2>


<P>
<PRE>
error: found processes still running as 'domjudge-run', check manually:
2342 apport
</PRE>

The above error occurs on submitting segmentation fault solutions if you have
apport installed (which is default on Ubuntu).
Disable or uninstall the apport daemon on all judgehosts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="problems:timelimits"></A> <A NAME="ss8.9">8.9</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc8.9">Enforcement of time limits</A>
</H2>


<P>Time limits within DOMjudge are enforced primarily in CPU time, and
secondly a more lax wall clock time limit is used to make sure that
submissions cannot idle and hog judgedaemons. The way that time limits
are calculated and passed through the system involves a number of
steps, so documented here.</P>
<P>Time limits are set per problem in seconds. Each language in turn may
define a time factor (defaulting to 1) that multiplies it to get a
specific time limit for that problem/language combination. This is
the <EM>soft timelimit</EM>. The configuration setting <CODE>timelimit
overshoot</CODE> is then used to calculate a <EM>hard timelimit</EM>.
This overshoot can be specified in terms of an absolute and relative
margin.</P>
<P>The <CODE>soft:hard</CODE> timelimit pair is passed
to <CODE>testcase_run.sh</CODE> and then on to <CODE>runguard</CODE> as both
wall clock and CPU limit. Since the CPU option is passed second, this
one is used by <CODE>runguard</CODE> when reporting whether the soft,
actual timelimit has been surpassed. The submitted program gets
killed when either the hard wall clock or CPU time has passed.</P>
